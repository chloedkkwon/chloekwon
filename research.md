    description: For my qualifying paper, I'm examining prosodic patterns exhibited by Korean L2 speakers of English compared to those of English natives. English and Korean are prosodically different languages, so I'm expecting distinct patterns to arise for the Korean L2 speakers from their L1 influence. It will be interesting to see how certain prosodic features are transferred from the speakers' L1 and how such transfer may differ individually.
