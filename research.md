    description: For my first qualifying paper, I examined prosodic patterns exhibited by Korean L2 speakers of English compared to those of English natives. English and Korean are prosodically two very different languages, so I expected distinct patterns to arise for the Korean L2 speakers from their L1 influence. Specifically, I hypothesized that the difference would stem from the fact that phrase edges are more prominent in Korean. So far, the result shows that L2 speakers are more consistently affected by boundary effects. My work shows that specific prosodic characteristics of L1 shapes the realization of L2 speech, which helps us understand why L2 speech sounds distinct from L1 in a systematic way.
